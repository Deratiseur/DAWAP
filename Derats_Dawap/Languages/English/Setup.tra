This spell enables the shaman to conjure up an image of the most abominable creature imaginable for the target of the spell, giving substance to the latter's worst fears. Only the victim can fully see the imaginary assassin, while the shaman perceives only a vague spectral form. The target is entitled to a saving throw against spells to understand that his assailant is merely a hallucination. If they fail to do so, they are affected by the illusion and must make a saving throw against death, or die of fright. Even if she succeeds in this second saving throw, the psychic shock is such that she suffers 3D6 points of damage.~

Each round after the first, the victim is entitled to a Save vs. Spell to avoid further damage.

Level: 4

Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 5-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

This spell conjures a sphere of glowing emerald acid that the caster can direct to strike any target within range. When it reaches its target, the sphere explodes and drenches the victim in potent acid. The victim suffers 1d4 points of acid damage per caster level, to a maximum of 12d4 points of damage. After the initial damage, the victim must save vs. Spell to avoid more damage. If unsuccessful, the victim continues to suffer acid damage in the following rounds, sustaining two less dice of damage each round. For example, an 8th-level wizard inflicts 8d4 damage with this spell on the first round, 6d4 on the second round, 4d4 on the third round, 2d4 on the fourth round, and the spell ends on the fifth round. Each round after the first, the victim is entitled to a Save vs. Spell to avoid further damage.

The vitriolic sphere also splashes acid in a 5-ft. radius around the primary target. Any creatures within the splash radius must save vs. Petrification/Polymorph or suffer a splash hit that inflicts 1d4 points of damage per every five levels of the caster. Splash hits do not cause continuing damage.~
